      <h2><i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Great UI / UX Design</h2>
      <p>Great user interfaces mean anyone who stumbles on your website is going to find what they need, and be in no hurry to leave. I create beautiful and aesthetically pleasing websites, but more importantly my websites are easy to navigate and use. Purposeful visual design choices help users find what they want quickly and easily.

      <h2><i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Form and Content</h2>
      <p>Sure, I can code. Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Node.js or a variety of smaller Javascript libraries is one thing. But knowing how to apply these technologies is a skill I've been honing my entire life.
      Growing up in a family of professors, and graduating from a selctive Liberal Arts and Philosophy program, I've been forced to hone my critical thinking and writing skills. Unlike most developers, I can help you not only with the frontend and backend code for your website, but with the content itself. This means that I understand the <em>context</em>. I don't just develop websites; I create a cohesive unified experience.

      <h2><i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> Individuated Attention</h2>
      <p>Sure, you could hire a large firm for your web-related solutions (and pay the associated cost), but for these corporations your website is just one of many. As a single freelancer, your project is always on my mind. I am constantly reading and learning about the newest web-technologies, and thinking about how we can apply them to your project.

      <h2><i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>  SEO</h2>
      <p>What is Search Engine Optimization or SEO? Search engines such as Google or DuckDuckGo crawl the web and index as many websites as they can. Using a proprietary secret algorythm they rate webpages using a varity of critrea. Why does this matter for your website? Well ask yourself, how many times have you gone to the second page of a google search? If you're like me, the answer is somewhere around "never," which means it is incredibly important that your page is in the first few results of any search engine. Using SEO best practises on your website means you are more likely to be at the top of any search-engines results.
